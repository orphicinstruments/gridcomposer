grid composer is a Max for Live midi generator, a new feature introduced in Ableton Live 12. with this device, your monome grid now becomes a direct and tactile interface for working with MIDI clips

grid composer allows you add and remove notes from MIDI clips, as well as edit select parameters like velocity, probability/chance, and duration. other parameters such as the clip start and end points may be modified as well

while not designed as a performance tool, grid composer also facilitates basic navigation of Liveâ€™s Session View. clips may be simply selected or launched for playback, allowing you to sketch ideas across multiple clips and tracks

inspired by the rich history of grid-based sequencers, including plane, kria, and numerous others
